      <p>Welcome to my website. This website is made for my coursework. This site is very easy to navigate through, just click the buttons on the left or right, this will take
      you to another page. The explore button will make your life easier. Clicking the explore button will automatically scroll to the bottom of the page rather than you having
    to do it manually, once at the bottom of the page you can click the back button which will take you back to the top.
    You can also navigate using the TAB key, it'll select a button for you and all you have to do it press enter.</p>

   <p>I've been interested in computers since I was 9. This interest has allowed me to take a career path. I have decided to study at RGU as it was one of a few universities
   that had cyber security course, it has great and positive reviews, and also it is not far from home. In my spare time I research news within the computing industry. I am dedicated
 to learn new things and take on many challenges to improve my skills and further enchance my employability chances in the near future.</p>
