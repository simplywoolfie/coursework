<p>I have worked on a few World of Warcraft private servers, Kronos was one of them. I was assigned to be one of the testers. My job was to find various bugs and glitches.
The most fun part of it was that I had permission to try and break the server then report on it. At the later stages of the project I was asked to scan through the code
and spot errors if there were any. After a year the server still remains open until this day.</p>

<p>Riot Games were developing a new improved client for League of Legends. I have volunteered to be part of the alpha testing team. Each member of the team had different aspects to test
within the client. I was testing the profile and store sections. I have discovered that opening up the profile page multiple times within a short period of time would crash the page
and won't let you to open it again unless to restart the client. We as a team had limited time, approximately 3 weeks, after that the client would open up to the public to test output
and use to their leisure. When working as a team I have gained various skills that will benefit me in the future.</p>
